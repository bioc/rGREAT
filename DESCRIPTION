Description: GREAT (Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool) is a type of
    functional enrichment analysis directly performed on genomic regions. This package 
    implements the GREAT algorithm (the local GREAT analysis), also it supports directly 
    interacting with the GREAT web service (the online GREAT analysis). Both analysis 
    can be viewed by a Shiny application. rGREAT by default supports more than 600 organisms 
    and a large number of gene set collections, as well as self-provided gene sets and 
    organisms from users. Additionally, it implements a general method for dealing 
    with background regions.
